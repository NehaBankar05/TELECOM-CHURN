# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Industry
This project focuses on predicting churn among high-value prepaid telecom customers in India and Southeast Asia by leveraging customer-level data. The goal is to identify customers at high risk of churning and understand the key factors contributing to churn, enabling telecom companies to implement effective retention strategies.

Key steps in this project include:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.  
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that capture meaningful insights, such as usage trends, recharge patterns, and data consumption ratios, to enhance the predictive power of the models. 
Dimensionality Reduction:  Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining the most critical information. 
Churn Prediction Models: Developing and training predictive models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to classify customers as churners or non-churners.
Indicator Analysis: Identifying the most significant predictors of churn from the models. 

Deliverables:

A well-documented Python codebase implementing the end-to-end process.
Comprehensive data analysis and visualization to highlight findings.
Detailed recommendations for reducing customer churn, particularly among high-value customers, based on the analysis and predictive insights.

By completing this project, telecom companies can effectively target at-risk customers, implement proactive retention strategies, and reduce revenue leakage.
